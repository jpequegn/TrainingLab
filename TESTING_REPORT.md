## 🚀 How to Execute Tests

### Option 1: Automated E2E Tests

```bash
# Start the development server
python server.py

# Run the E2E tests
npx playwright test tests/e2e/history-page.spec.js --headed --reporter=list

# Or use the test runner
node run-history-tests.js
```

### Option 2: Manual Testing

```bash
# Start the development server
python server.py

# Open the manual test checklist
# Navigate to: file:///.../manual-test-history.html
# Or serve it via: python -m http.server 8080
```

### Option 3: Quick Batch Test (Windows)

```bash
# Run the batch file
run-tests.bat
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. **Server Not Starting**

```
Error: Server failed to start on port 3000
Solution: Check if port is already in use, try alternative port
```

#### 2. **Tests Timing Out**

```
Error: Page load timeout after 15000ms
Solution: Increase timeouts, check server startup time
```

#### 3. **Chart.js Not Loading**

```
Issue: Charts appear empty or throw errors
Solution: Verify CDN link in HTML, check network connectivity
```

#### 4. **Mock Data Issues**

```
Issue: No activities or TSS indicators visible
Solution: Check mock data generation in HistoryPage.loadMockActivities()
```

#### 5. **Component State Problems**

```
Issue: View switching doesn't work properly
Solution: Verify CSS classes and JavaScript event handlers
```
