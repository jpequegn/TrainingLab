## Detailed Analysis

### Main Content Area Centering
**Status: ✅ EXCELLENT**

- **Viewport 1280x720**: Container centered at X:632.5, viewport center at X:640 (offset: 7.5px)
- **Full HD 1920x1080**: Container centered at X:952.5, viewport center at X:960 (offset: 7.5px)
- **Responsive behavior**: Consistent 7.5px offset across all resolutions

**Verdict**: The main content area is extremely well centered with minimal offset (< 8px) across all tested resolutions.

### Layout Structure Analysis

The application uses a **two-panel layout**:
- **Left Panel**: Main content area (well-centered)
- **Right Panel**: Chat/AI assistant panel (~229px wide)

The centering algorithm correctly accounts for the available viewport space, excluding the chat panel width.

### Workout Power Profile Chart Centering
**Status: ✅ EXCELLENT**

- **Chart Position**: X:600.98, Viewport Center: X:640 (offset: 39px)
- **Chart Load**: Successfully loads via "Sample" button
- **Visibility**: Chart renders properly and is well-positioned

**Verdict**: Chart centering is excellent with only 39px offset from center.

### Upload Section Analysis
**Status: ❌ NEEDS IMPROVEMENT**

- **Current Position**: X:134.66 (far left of viewport)
- **Expected Position**: Should be closer to X:640 (viewport center)
- **Offset**: 505px from center (significantly off-center)

**Issue**: The file upload input is positioned in the lower left corner rather than being centered.

### Responsive Design Testing
**Status: ✅ EXCELLENT**

Tested across multiple resolutions:
- **1920x1080 (Full HD)**: 7.5px offset ✅
- **1366x768 (Laptop)**: 7.5px offset ✅  
- **1024x768 (Tablet Landscape)**: 7.5px offset ✅
- **768x1024 (Tablet Portrait)**: 7.5px offset ✅

**Verdict**: Consistent centering behavior across all screen sizes.

## Visual Evidence

1. Clean, modern interface with proper spacing
2. Chat panel properly positioned on the right
3. Main content area well-centered in available space
4. Power profile chart displays correctly when sample data is loaded

## Technical Measurements

### Layout Dimensions (1280x720 viewport)
- **Main Container**: x:0, y:0, width:1280px, height:64px
- **File Input**: x:65, y:656, width:139px, height:96px
- **Chat Panel**: x:977, y:73, width:229px, height:226px
- **Available Content Width**: ~977px (excluding chat panel)
- **Content Center Target**: ~488px (half of available width)

## Recommendations

### 1. Fix Upload Section Centering (Priority: Medium)
The file input button should be repositioned from its current location (x:65) to be more centered in the available content area.

### 2. Consider LLM Textbox Integration (Priority: Low)
While no dedicated LLM textbox was found, the chat functionality appears to be integrated into the right panel, which is working correctly.
